    "Dynamics deals with changes or the evolution of a system with respect to time. In the area of systems biology dynamics typically refer to the changes in molecular concentrations (or numbers) within a cell with respect time. These allow scientist to understand the behaiviour of the system (the growth of cells in a tissue, the production of mRNA's by genes etc) they are considering. The molecular information from the system can be represented as \n",
    "network and later transformed into systems of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE's) to overcome the curse of complexity. Systems of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE's) based kinetic models are built to capture all the available kinetic information about biological system. These equations are used extensively in systems biology especially for the purpose of predicting time dependent profiles and steady state levels of biochemical species in conditions given the state of a system now, the state of the system at some future time where experimental data is not available.

There are two main types of ODE models used in the area of system biology. The linear ODE model and Nonlinear ODE models. The system of ODE's is said to be linear if the function $f$ used in the equation is linear function and nonlinear if the function $f$ used in the equation is  a nonlinear function."
