# Dynamical_Optimization_of_Circadian_Clock_Modeling_Parameters.
Sensitivity Analysis and Optimization of Parameters of the Mammalian Circadian Clock Systems of Ordinary Differential Equation Model.

This project is to use the Advanced Model Identification using Global Optimization (AMIGO2_R2019b) Toolbox in Matlab to discuss the Sensitivity Analysis and Optimization of Parameters of the Mammalian Circadian Clock Systems of Ordinary Differential Equation Model.

# Installation

Download all the documents from the folder 

./AMIGO_R2019/



Start a Matlab session and change the working directory to the AMIGO2_R2019b folder

# Install MinGW-w64 Compiler

MinGW-w64 is a compiler suite for Windows based on the GNU tool chain. It includes a GCC compiler and related tools for compiling C and C++ applications for Windows. C and C++ applications compiled with MinGW-w64 GCC can be called from MATLAB using MEX. This GCC compiler can also be helpful for other MathWorks products that require a C or C++ compiler.

 To install the compiler, use the Add-Ons menu.

1. On the MATLAB Home tab, in the Environment section, click Add-Ons > Get Add-Ons.

2. Search for MinGW or select from Features.

3. Type:


> AMIGO_Startup
      
      2. Access AMIGO2 HTML Help under the MATLAB Help - Supplemental Software link.

          NOTE for MAC users: AMIGO2 incorporates some mex files to frotran optimizers. Please follow the
          instructions provided in the file AMIGO2/Examples/README_EXAMPLES.m to use these solvers in
         Macintosh Operating Systems.
