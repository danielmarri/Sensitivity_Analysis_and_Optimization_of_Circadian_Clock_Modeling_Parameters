# Dynamical_Optimization_of_Circadian_Clock_Modeling_Parameters.
Sensitivity Analysis and Optimization of Parameters of the Mammalian Circadian Clock Systems of Ordinary Differential Equation Model.

This project is to use the Advanced Model Identification using Global Optimization (AMIGO2_R2019b) Toolbox in Matlab to discuss the Sensitivity Analysis and Optimization of Parameters of the Mammalian Circadian Clock Systems of Ordinary Differential Equation Model.


# Directory information

- Reports/ : Contains biweekly assignments and reports for the course
- AMIGO/  : Contains the AMIGO_R2019b folder where the codes for the project can be found and Tests folder where testing codes for the project can be found.




# Installation

Download all the documents from the folder 

./AMIGO_R2019b/



Start a Matlab session and change the working directory to the AMIGO2_R2019b folder

# Install MinGW-w64 Compiler for windows users.

MinGW-w64 is a compiler suite for Windows based on the GNU tool chain. It includes a GCC compiler and related tools for compiling C and C++ applications for Windows. C and C++ applications compiled with MinGW-w64 GCC can be called from MATLAB using MEX. This GCC compiler can also be helpful for other MathWorks products that require a C or C++ compiler.

 To install the compiler, use the Add-Ons menu.

1. On the MATLAB Home tab, in the Environment section, click Add-Ons > Get Add-Ons.

2. Search for MinGW or select from Features.

3. Type:


> AMIGO_Startup

This add all the paths needed for the project to the MATLAB session.
      
# The AMIGO2_R2019b folder is a developed Toolbox in MATLAB. The codes that I wrote and added to thia Toolbox is found in the AMIGO2_R2019b/Model_Simulation_and_Analysis/Model_Simulation/  folder and the  AMIGO2_R2019b/Model_Simulation_and_Analysis/Local_and_Global_Sensitivity_Analysis/
