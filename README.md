# Dynamical_Optimization_of_Circadian_Clock_Modeling_Parameters.
Sensitivity Analysis and Optimization of Parameters of the Mammalian Circadian Clock Systems of Ordinary Differential Equation Model.

This project is to use the Advanced Model Identification using Global Optimization (AMIGO2_R2019b) Toolbox in Matlab to discuss the Sensitivity Analysis and Optimization of Parameters of the Mammalian Circadian Clock Systems of Ordinary Differential Equation Model.

The code for this project can be seen in the Folder Sensitivity_Analysis_and_Optimization_of_Circadian_Clock_Modeling_Parameters/Sensitivity_Analysis_and_Optimization_of_CC_Model_Parameters/


# Installation

Download all the documents from the folder 

/Sensitivity_Analysis_and_Optimization_of_CC_Model_Parameters/



Start a Matlab session and change the working directory to the AMIGO2_R2019b folder

Type:


> AMIGO_Startup
      
      2. Access AMIGO2 HTML Help under the MATLAB Help - Supplemental Software link.

          NOTE for MAC users: AMIGO2 incorporates some mex files to frotran optimizers. Please follow the
          instructions provided in the file AMIGO2/Examples/README_EXAMPLES.m to use these solvers in
         Macintosh Operating Systems.
